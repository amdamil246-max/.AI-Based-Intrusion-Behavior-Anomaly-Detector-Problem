As cyberattacks continue to evolve, traditional authentication safeguards such as passwords, two-factor authentication (2FA), and biometric verification are no longer sufficient to identify unauthorized users who successfully obtain or mimic legitimate credentials. Attackers increasingly rely on automated scripts, AI bots, remote access malware, and insider collusion to impersonate real users in enterprise environments. These threats behave like normal users at the credential level, making legacy intrusion-detection systems largely blind. To address this emerging security challenge, this research presents CORTEX X: Zero Trust Behavioral Defense System, an advanced artificial intelligence–driven intrusion and behavior anomaly detector designed to authenticate the human—not the credentials—and prevent unauthorized access in real time.

Unlike standard security systems that only validate user identity during login, CORTEX X continuously observes neuromuscular, cognitive, and interaction-based behavioral signals throughout the session. The system first deploys Physical Layer Behavioral Biometrics, capturing keystroke dynamics such as dwell time and flight time, which reflect natural human muscular cadence and rhythm. These patterns make it extremely difficult for malware or AI bots to replicate human variability. Additionally, mouse telemetry is monitored to analyze microscopic movement vectors, curves, velocity and acceleration patterns, which differ sharply between human hand-eye behavior and robotic motor patterns. A visual interaction heatmap further illustrates real-time behavioral traces, enabling intuitive interpretation and enhancing system transparency.

To expand the trust boundary beyond credentials, the system incorporates a Device and Hardware Layer powered by GPU-based canvas fingerprinting, generating a unique cryptographic 0xHash derived from internal rendering behavior. This fingerprint acts as a secure device identity without exposing personal hardware information. In parallel, the architecture is prepared for gyroscope telemetry to support mobile environments and motion-based authentication. Even if credentials are stolen, and even if behavioral patterns are imitated, the absence or mismatch of the correct device-fingerprint introduces immediate suspicion.

Building on physical and hardware authentication, CORTEX X introduces a Cognitive and Forensic Layer, in which user intent and context are continuously assessed. The Focus Integrity Auditing module monitors whether a user unexpectedly switches tabs—behavior often correlated with password pasting, script execution, or external references during privilege abuse. Clipboard forensics detect sudden bulk-text pastes, identifying “Paste Attacks” used by credential-harvesting malware or bot-driven SQL exploitation kits. Furthermore, an Adaptive Mood Calibration technique evaluates the user’s energy level during the first ten keystrokes, distinguishing natural variation (e.g., tired typing vs. hyperactive typing) from malicious tempo manipulation to avoid false positives. This contextual intelligence allows the system to differentiate harmless human behavior shifts from anomalous automation-driven patterns.

To defend against insider threats—recognized as one of the most destructive and difficult-to-detect attack types—CORTEX X uses a dedicated Insider Threat Defense Module. The interface includes honeypot traps, such as invisible UI elements and decoy “Admin Files,” placed intentionally to attract unauthorized curiosity or malicious intent. Interaction with these hidden triggers—harmless to legitimate users—results in immediate session lockdown, given the high probability of malicious intent. Additionally, real-time semantic syntax scanning detects SQL keywords, JavaScript payloads, and script injection patterns within typed or pasted content (e.g., SELECT *, <script>), identifying attack attempts at the earliest stage—even before they reach the server.

CORTEX X incorporates structured governance and threat attribution through a real-time Collective Intelligence System, enabling distributed anomaly sharing without compromising user privacy. This simulated threat feed allows the system to proactively detect new attack signatures rather than remaining passive. For impact quantification, all behavioral anomalies are aggregated into a standardized CVSS-based risk score, ranging from 0.0 (benign) to 10.0 (critical), allowing security analysts to grasp threat severity instantly and respond with confidence.

The prototype is built using a performance-centric technology stack, featuring HTML5 and TailwindCSS for lightweight UI, Vanilla JavaScript for 60fps sensor polling and computation, and dynamic DOM visualization for real-time metrics and heatmaps. The system requires no backend or installation; it runs locally in any modern browser, enabling fast deployment, privacy-preserving data handling, and frictionless offline demos.

In demonstration mode, users can intentionally simulate threats to observe real-time detection. Normal typing generates low-risk scores, extremely rapid uniform typing triggers bot detection, tab switching raises Focus Alerts, and interacting with honeypot decoys activates full session lockdown. These live reactions highlight the precision and practicality of behavioral, cognitive, and forensic authentication.

In conclusion, CORTEX X represents a pivotal shift toward Zero Trust Behavioral Defense, establishing authentication not on credentials but on the user’s biological, cognitive, and intentional signatures. Through the integration of biometrics, device intelligence, forensic telemetry, deception techniques, and risk-scored adaptive defense, CORTEX X provides a robust and scalable path for defeating identity theft, malware automation, and insider privilege misuse in modern cyber ecosystems.
